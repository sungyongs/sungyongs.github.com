My first post. I am working in December & Company using iMac. Tonight, I am going to meet my lovely honey who loves delicious things very much. :)
For dinner, I suggested chi-mac which means chicken with beer and I was sure that she loved it. However, she looked unhappy and gave me another idea, which was pi-mac, pizza with beer. 
It wouldn't be matter to me because I also love pizza. So, frankly speaking, I was really open mind when we talked about today's menu.
However, I heard that.. she already had pa-dac which means chicken with green onions when I went Nokyang for military drill. Finally, I understood why she was unhappy (she doesn't really like to have similar food in the same week..)!
Isn't she lovely?

We are going to meet Sookmyung women's university station (Exit 7) arount 19:00.

I am looking forward to enjoying tonight wih my ho-ney-boo~
